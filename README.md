A BaseCamp Clone Demo Project
==============================

Doing this project to help me learn rails. It'll be
fun to learn about linking all the different parts
up with rails relationships and learning about how
rails can make my life easier. I've already seen
lots of things it has made so much easier compared
to php.

The testing is pretty cool as well, I'm very curious
in test-driven development. It's intriguing to be able
to write major functionality by just writting tests
for everything and get it working before even looking
at the site and dealing with the forms.

Cheers!
